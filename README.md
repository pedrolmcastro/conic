# Conic

## Overview

A python application that identifies a conic given its general form equation. All codes are under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

## Usage

Executing `main.py`, the user needs to insert a conic equation in the form:

Ax<sup>2</sup> + Bxy + Cy<sup>2</sup> + Dx + Ey + F

with A, B and C **not all** equal to 0.

The program will then print the conic identified and some of its information.

## Observation

This application was developed by a Computer Science student for academic and learning purposes, because of that the code may not be the safest or most efficient one.
